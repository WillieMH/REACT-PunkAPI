# ReactProject - Punk API

## Brief
Requirements


## Plan


### Final State


### Issues & Resolutions
1. Code is an utter shambles.  Poor planning led to reworked code going all over the place
2. BEM - What is BEM, absolutely no evidence of any in this project, again, poor planning.


### Reflection
- Prior planning is invaluable.  Using a significant proportion of the time budget to plan correclty inc colour scheme, layout, class/id structure as well as App & component layout would be much better than redoing lots of work at the end.
- Use Sass Variables, such an easy way to alter the colour scheme effortlessly - needs to be implemented before building other style parameters
- Work one module/component at a time, commit then branch the next new part, saves a lot of heartache at the end when trying to rewrite everything.
